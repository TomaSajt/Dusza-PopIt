### Built with

## Usage

You can control the game using a keyboard or by using a mouse.

When in-game use the arrow keys to navigate the cursor around the board. Pressing space will push the selected position. Be careful, after you've pushed one, you can only push the neigbours with the same color. You can also use the mouse to push a cell by left clicking on it. To hand over control to the next player, press the ENTER key.
The game ends when all of the cells have been pushed. In 2 player mode, the winner is the person who didn't push the last cell. With 3 or more player it is the player who would come after the person who pushed the last cell.
